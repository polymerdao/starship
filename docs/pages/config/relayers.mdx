# Relayers YAML Syntax

We will go into details of the `relayers` top level directive in the Starship config file.

> Note: By default the `relayers` will open up a `transfer` port

## `name`
Name of the relayer, this is used as a unique identifier for the relayer.
```yaml
relayers:
- name: hermes-osmo-juno
  ...
```

## `type`
Type of the relayer to spin up. Currently we support:
* [hermes](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes)
* [ts-relayer](https://github.com/confio/ts-relayer)

```yaml
relayers:
- name: hermes-osmo-juno
  type: hermes
  ...
- name: ts-relayer-cosmos-juno
  type: ts-relayer
  ...
```

## `image` (optional)
If one wants to use a specific version of the relayer we support,
then it can be mentioned via this image directive.

Supported version of relayers can be found:
* [`hermes` versions](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/pkgs/container/starship%2Fhermes/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged)
* [`ts-relayer` versions](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/pkgs/container/starship%2Fts-relayer/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged)

```yaml
relayers:
- name: hermes-osmo-juno
  type: hermes
  image: ghcr.io/cosmology-tech/starship/hermes:1.5.1
  ...
- name: ts-relayer-cosmos-juno
  type: ts-relayer
  image: ghcr.io/cosmology-tech/starship/ts-relayer:0.9.0
  ...
```

## `replicas`
Number of relayers to spin up. Currently we just support 1 replica for now.
```yaml
relayers:
- name: hermes-osmo-juno
  type: hermes
  replicas: 1
  ...
```

## `chains`
List of chains to connect to each other, via the Relayer.
Must be `name` of chains defined in the `chains` directive.

```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  ...
- name: juno-2
  ...
- name: gaia-4
  ...

relayers:
- name: hermes-osmo-juno
  type: hermes
  replicas: 1
  chains:
  - osmosis-1
  - juno-2
- name: ts-relayer-osmo-gaia
  type: ts-relayer
  replicas: 1
  chains:
  - osmosis-1
  - gaia-4
```

## `config` (optional, hermes only)

For `type: hermes` relayer, we support overriding the default config params with the `config` directive.
User specified overrides are performed at the start.

> Note: Currently we only allow overrides of non chain specific values

```yaml
relayers:
- name: hermes-osmo-juno
  type: hermes
  replicas: 1
  chains:
  - osmosis-1
  - juno-1
  config:
    global:
      log_level: "error"
    rest:
      enabled: false
    telemetry:
      enabled: false
    ## event_source is a custom configuration, in hermes is set of each of the chains
    ## one just needs to mention the mode (push or pull), and we do the rest
    ## For reference: https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/releases/tag/v1.6.0
    event_source:
      mode: "pull" # default is "push"
```

All allowed config params can be found in the [default values](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/pull/185/files#diff-b6d755bc9ec9f0229fa0fc7beff17964f31889df81dbd5a16764ed8cdecbfa96R286-R310)
(Basically everything in [config.toml](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/blob/master/config.toml#L8...L111) file for the hermes relayer)
